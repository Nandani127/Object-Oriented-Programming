LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

We want to design a book check out/return/claim management system of a small library.
How does the system work?
o Every patron has a uniue numerical id.
o Every book has a uniue accession number.

o Check Out - A patron can check out upto 3 books at any time.

o Claim - If patron X has not already checked out 3 books, he/she can claim a book checked out by patron Y. 
                When Y returns the book it is held for X and cannot be lent to others.

o Return - A patron can return a book checked out by her/him at any time.
                  No late charges!
